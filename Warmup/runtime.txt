Runtimes:
for --systemcalls:
real:5.541s
user:1.462s
sys:4.089s

Without Systemcalls (using stdio library)
real:2.097s
user:.913s
sys:1.827s

System calls are costly and end up taking more time to run programs than ones that call the standard library. This is why --systemcalls running of the program takes more time than using the stdio library.
